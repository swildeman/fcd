# FCD
Fast Checkerboard Demodulation (FCD) for Synthetic Schlieren imaging

# Usage
For all functions to work properly the scripts in sub-directory **./general** should be on your MATLAB path. Usage examples are found in the **./examples** sub-directory. Type `help functionname` on the MATLAB prompt for function specific usage info (or see the comments inside the function file).

# More information
Information on the FCD technique and the employed algorithms can be found in: S. Wildeman (2018), *Real-time quantitative Schlieren imaging by fast Fourier demodulation of a checkered backdrop*, Exp. Fluids (in press), https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05679 (preprint)
